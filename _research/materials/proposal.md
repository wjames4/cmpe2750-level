# Wyatt James Level Project Proposal

## **Abstract**
I would like to make a portable small level. The level will consist of a
display that will have a "bubble" similar to how a analog level appears.

## **Hardware**
My MCU of choice is the **STM32G031** leveraging the nucleo board version for
inital testing. 

This will take adavantage of the **MPU-6050** gyroscope to measure orientation
of the board. I have not worked with a component like this before so this will
take some experimentation and reading of the datasheet. It will use the
I^2^C protocol to interface with MCU.
